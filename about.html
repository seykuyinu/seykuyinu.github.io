        <p>
          I am a software engineer with experience building back-end services in Python, Ruby & NodeJs...... (and Java way back in the day).
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently embarking on the technical leadership journey and learning about being a pragmatic engineer.
          I find joy in mentoring and coaching engineers, and building the right team and engineering culture to enable a high performing team. 
        </p>
        <h3>When I'm not working... </h3>
        <p>
          I play netball, read (mostly fiction), go to the theatre, watch live sports, binge a Netflix series 
          or two, and spend time with family and friends. 
        </p>
        <h3>Currently learning about...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Photography</li>
          <li>Personal finance, investing and property</li>
        </ul>
